# Write a program that iterates over an array and builds a new array 
# that is the result of incrementing each value in the original array 
# by a value of 2. You should have two arrays at the end of this program, 
# The original array and the new array you've created. Print both arrays to the 
# screen using the p method instead of puts.

arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

x = arr.map {|x| x + 2}
