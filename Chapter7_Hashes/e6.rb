x = "hi there"
my_hash = {x: "some value"}
my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}

# What's the difference between the two hashes that were created?

# there is no difference? my_hash is the new ruby syntax aand my_hash2 is 
# ruby pre version 1.9

# correct answer... 

# the key in my_hash is a symbol
# the key in my_hash2 is referencing the variable x from line 1
# i got confused between the old and new ruby syntax
# the old syntax is {:key => value} so this confused me. good to know!
